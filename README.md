# Build-A-Face-Tracking-Camera-With-Computer-Vision
11th April 2020 - In this workshop, we’ll show you to build a modified webcam apparatus, set on servos attached to an Arduino, that will identify faces using Computer Vision. Once a face has been identified using OpenCV, the servos will move the camera to ‘follow’ the face around while it’s still in view.
